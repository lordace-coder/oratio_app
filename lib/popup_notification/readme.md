Add this to your package's `pubspec.yaml` file:

dependencies:
  popup_notification:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/yourusername/popup_notification.git
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize

In your `main.dart` file where you configure GoRouter:

```dart
final router = GoRouter(
  // your routes configuration
);

void main() {
  // Initialize popup notification with your router
  PopupNotification.init(router);
  
  runApp(MyApp(router: router));
}
```

### 2. Show a Popup

Show a popup from anywhere in your app:

```dart
PopupNotification.show(
  title: "New Message",
  message: "Hey, how are you?",
  avatarUrl: "https://example.com/avatar.jpg",
  onTap: () {
    // Handle tap action
  },
  duration: Duration(seconds: 3),
);
```

## Examples

### Basic Notification
```dart
PopupNotification.show(
  title: "Simple Notification",
  message: "This is a basic notification",
);
```

### With Avatar and Navigation
```dart
PopupNotification.show(
  title: "John Doe",
  message: "Hey! Check out this new feature...",
  avatarUrl: "https://example.com/john.jpg",
  onTap: () => router.push('/chat/john-doe'),
);
```

### Custom Duration
```dart
PopupNotification.show(
  title: "Quick Alert",
  message: "This will disappear in 1 second",
  duration: Duration(seconds: 1),
);
```

## Customization

### Styling

The popup uses Google Fonts' Inter font family by default. You can modify the styling by editing the `_PopupNotificationWidget` class:

```dart
Text(
  title,
  style: GoogleFonts.inter(
    fontSize: 16,
    fontWeight: FontWeight.w600,
  ),
),
```

### Animation

The popup uses the `animate_do` package for the entrance animation. You can modify the animation by adjusting the `FadeInDown` widget parameters:

```dart
FadeInDown(
  duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 300),
  child: // ... your widget
),
```

## Requirements
